# High Speed Linear Test (HiLiTe) | Data Science Project | Python 
Project developed at the Institut für Dynamik und Schwigungen of the Leibniz Universität, Hannover/Germany.

Introduction:
HiLiTe is a test rig used to simulate the dinamic contact between a rubber and a track. It is possible to set different parameters and measure Friction Force, Normal Force and Coefficient of Friction.

Main Goal:
The main goal is to understand the dinamic behavior of the tire material subjected to different track frequencies

Metodology:
- The first step was to model the surfaces using a 3D software (eg.Solidworks);
- Then to use a 3D printer to print them;
- Measure the Data in the HiLite using different condictions: track frequency (7), velocities (10), pressures(3), backward/forward* and dry/wet**
- Treat, Analyse and visualize the data using Python 

Results:
- It was possible to make comparissons between the different condictions
- The project is still running and will be published in the future in a german paper
